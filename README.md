After attending a coding bootcamp focused on increasing gender diversity in tech in Seattle, I worked as a full stack software engineer at AWS building out web apps supporting millions of hits per months. After spending a few years solidifying my tech skills, I shifted from development to join a remote, mission driven company. Now I lead Product at Microverse, where we're building a global, multi-cultural school preparing the next wave of talent for our increasingly international, remote world. We help our students from all around the world achieve life changing career goals and help companies cultivate talent without location constraints",
