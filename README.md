For this reason, Camus‚Äôs family decided to move to Spain, where he lived in the Canary Islands for four years, until he moved to Madrid to study telecommunications engineering. In his last university years, Ariel started his first startup: TouristEye, an online platform that allowed users to evaluate, review, and plans the destinations and activities of their trip. The organization gained value thanks to the millions of downloads and constant interaction with the client until Ariel decided to sell it to Lonely Planet, an Australian company focused on travel books.",
